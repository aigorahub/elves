All notable changes to the Elves skill are documented here.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-21

### Core Skill

- Interactive planning phase: the agent and user collaborate on scope, batches, and configuration before any code is written
- Multi-batch execution with user-defined sprint sizing (default: 4 developers x 2-week sprint)
- Core loop: Orient, Tag, Implement, Validate, Review, Document, Update, Push, Re-read, Continue
- Three-document compaction survival system (Plan, Survival Guide, Execution Log)
- Subagent delegation for long runs (Claude Code): implementer, validator, reviewer, scout
- Scout mode for bonus improvements after planned batches are done
- Time-aware pacing with session budgets
- Rollback safety with `elves/pre-batch-N` git tags
- Structured session data in `.elves-session.json`
- Persistent preferences via `config.json`
- Skill memory: execution logs improve over time

### Safety

- Forbidden commands: `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git push --force`, `git rebase` on shared branches
- Test integrity: never modify a test to make it pass. Fix the code, not the test
- Non-interactive operation with `CI=true` and comprehensive env var hardening
- Mid-run check-in protocol: answer concisely, keep going
- PreToolUse hook example for deterministic enforcement of forbidden commands
- Survey and popup suppression guidance for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor

### Validation

- Two-stage validation: local gates then preview deployment
- Auto-discovery for Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, and Makefile projects
- Zero accumulated debt philosophy: every batch must be production-ready
- Verification patterns: headless browser drivers, video recording, smoke testing, state assertions, custom scripts

### Review

- Built-in review subagent reads PR comments, bot reviews, and CI status (zero config)
- Adversarial review pattern: fresh-eyes subagent with no implementation context
- Custom review API support (opt-in)
- Additional checks: smoke tests, visual review, doc review, custom scripts
- Finding triage: genuine issues, intentional design choices, false positives

### Documentation

- README with origin story, Ralph Loop, Human Sandwich, and honest v0 framing
- "What to expect" section with real ROI numbers (6-9 months of work in 3-4 hours of human time)
- "Riding along" guidance: say "do not stop" in every message
- "What can go wrong" failure modes table with mitigations
- Preventing sleep/shutdown guide (caffeinate, systemd-inhibit, tmux/screen)
- Monitoring with GitKraken and Slack notifications
- Claude Code hooks: SessionStart for auto-loading context, PreToolUse for forbidden commands
- Installation guide: global and per-project for Claude Code, Codex, Claude.ai
- "Making it your own" customization guidance
- Daily briefing and Friday planning cadence

### Templates

- Survival guide template with non-negotiables, tool config, and safe rollback procedures
- Execution log template with timing breakdown and Ralph Loop framing
- Plan template with worked example (auth system refactor) and Human Sandwich framing
- Kickoff prompt template (minimal and full versions) with daily briefing guidance
- Tool configuration examples for Node, Python, Go, Rust, monorepos, and custom APIs

### Scripts

- `preflight.sh`: comprehensive pre-run checklist (git, auth, project detection, sleep prevention, gates, notifications, env vars, survey suppression, branch staleness)
- `notify.sh`: Slack webhook, custom command, or PR comment notification helper. Returns proper exit codes in --test mode for preflight validation

### Platform Support

- Claude Code (SKILL.md): full feature set with subagents and hooks
- Codex (AGENTS.md): direct execution, concise format
- Claude.ai: zip upload
- Any Agent Skills compatible platform (open standard)
- Passes `agentskills validate`
